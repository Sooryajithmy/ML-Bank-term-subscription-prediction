 ML-Bank-term-subscription-prediction
 
The data is related with direct marketing campaigns of a Portuguese banking institution for subscription to term deposit. The marketing campaigns were based on phone calls. Often, more than one contact to the same client was required, in order to access if the product (bank term deposit) was subscribed or not.
Data set has 20 predictor variables (features) and around 41K rows.
The dataset is collected from UCI Repository - "https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/bank+marketing"
A term deposit is a type of deposit account held at a financial institution where money is locked up for some set period of time.Term deposits are usually short-term deposits with maturities ranging from one month to a few years.Typically, term deposits offer higher interest rates than traditional liquid savings accounts, whereby
customers can withdraw their money at any time.
GOAL
Using the data collected from existing customers, we have to build a model that will help the marketing team identify potential customers who are relatively more likely to subscribe to term deposits and thus increase their marketing towards those customers.
Business goal: Reducing marketing resources by identifying customers who would subscribe to term deposit and thereby direct marketing efforts to them.
